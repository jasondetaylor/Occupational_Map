Choosing a career path is one of the most significant decisions individuals make in their lives, often influencing their personal and professional fulfillment. This project aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to individuals, particularly students and job seekers, as they navigate the complex landscape of career choices.

By leveraging dimensionality reduction, this project explores the similarity between different occupations based on a wide range of metrics. These metrics include skills, knowledge, experience, and other factors obtained from the comprehensive O*NET dataset.

The aim of this project is to offer an interactive platform where users can visualize the relationships between occupations, identify clusters of similar professions, and gain a deeper understanding of potential career paths. Whether you're a high school student exploring future educational opportunities, a college graduate contemplating career options, or a seasoned professional considering a career change, this project aims to empower you with valuable insights to make informed decisions about your professional journey.
